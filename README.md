# OrganoidEC-Repo
Independent single-cell RNA-seq analysis of human heart organoids (Aguirre lab GSE218582) and fetal heart reference (GSE106118).
The analysis was performed independently to explore vascularization defects in engineered cardiac organoids.

Workflow: QC → integration → tip EC analysis → differential expression analysis → vascularization hypothesis.

Note: Data are not included in this repository. Scripts assume GEO (GSE106118) and EMM2 datasets are placed under data/raw/ as described in data/README.md.
